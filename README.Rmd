The goal of `micro4R` was to create an R package for essentially a past version of myself. I started my career in microbiome research at the bench and had to [ELI5](https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExY3hrYzg1a2I2eGtuNWIwYTRqNDMzNGE0cWlkNGE5OXB4ZHV1YXY4dCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/WsNbxuFkLi3IuGI9NU/giphy.gif) to myself how to process and analyze "big data". I've spent a ton of time poring over and experimenting with [others' code]UPDATE URL. # micro4R <a href="https://mshilts1.github.io/micro4R/"><img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="139" alt="micro4R website" /></a> Likely, the ideal candidate to benefit from `micro4R` would be another bench scientist without much formal statistics or bioinformatics training. Fair warning, if you already have a strong stats/informatics background, this may not be of much use for you!        


This package does not create any brand new functionality and was built on the great work of [others]UPDATE URL. Much of what it does can be accomplished with other packages. For example, [phyloseq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/phyloseq.html), [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org), and [MicrobiomeAnalyst](https://www.microbiomeanalyst.ca) are a few very well-known, well-documented, and heavily used tools for microbiome analysis. One or these may be better for your purposes, and I'd encourage anyone new to the field to explore multiple tools.    
    
R packages heavily used here include:    
1. [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org) ecosystem   
2. [vegan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html)   
3. [dada2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/)   
4. [maaslin3](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/maaslin3/)

## Installation

You can install the development version of micro4R like so:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("mshilts1/micro4R")
```

## Example

I'll run through the smallest and simplest possible use case below. For more detailed help and documentation, please explore the vignettes (link TBA)

```{r example}
library(micro4R)
