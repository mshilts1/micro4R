\usage{
assess_run(
  metadata = NULL,
  asvtable = NULL,
  wells = "Well",
  plate = NULL,
  category = NULL,
  minReads = 0,
  pcoa = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{metadata}{metadata object}

\item{asvtable}{asvtable object}

\item{wells}{wells for each sample. Expecting A01, A02, etc.}

\item{plate}{plate samples were on. Can be left as NULL if there's only one plate.}

\item{category}{Varible to label wells by. Makes the most sense if positive and negative controls are labeled.}

\item{minReads}{Minimum number of total reads for sample to be kept. Recommend to keep it at 0, but can change that if you want.}

\item{pcoa}{Include PCoA data (can significantly increase run time, so set to FALSE by default)}

\item{...}{Allows passing of arguments to nested functions. not being used at the moment.}
